#### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
By default, it also [includes a service worker](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#making-a-progressive-web-app) so that your app loads from local cache on future visits.

Your app is ready to be deployed.
